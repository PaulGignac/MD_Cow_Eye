The sclera - This is the white, tough outer layer of the eye that protects the delicate inner parts.
The cornea - This is the clear, dome-shaped structure at the front of the eye that helps to focus incoming light.
The iris - This is the colored part of the eye that controls the size of the pupil and therefore the amount of light that enters the eye.
The pupil - This is the dark, round opening in the center of the iris that changes size in response to light.
The lens - This is a transparent structure located behind the pupil that further focuses the incoming light.
The vitreous humor - This is a clear, jelly-like substance that fills the space between the lens and the retina.
The retina - This is a thin layer of tissue that lines the back of the eye and contains photoreceptor cells that are sensitive to light.
The optic nerve - This is a bundle of nerves that transmits visual information from the retina to the brain.
The choroid - This is a thick, vascular layer of tissue that lies between the sclera and the retina and provides blood supply to the eye.
The ciliary body - This is a structure located at the back of the iris that produces tears and mucus to keep the eye moist and lubricated.
