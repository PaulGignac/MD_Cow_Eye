# MD_Cow_Eye
MorphoDepot repository for 3D rendering a cow eye

Cow eye, sourced from Carolina Biologicla Supply, was fixed and stored in Carolina "Perfect" Solution. It was stained with buffered lugol's iodine (2.5% for 14 days) and subsequently CT scanned at the University of Arizona Nanofabrication Laboratory on a Shimadzu InspeXio micro-CT scanner at 39 microns (isometric voxels). The scan metadata files (text file, image file) are included with the repository. Briefly, the scan parameters were 150 kV, 120 micro-Amps, 2400 rotation steps with 3-times image averaging, and no filtration.
