# MD_Cow_Eye
MorphoDepot repository for 3D rendering a cow eye

Cow eye, fixed and stained, was CT scanned at 39 microns (isometric voxels) using a Shimadzu InspeXio micro-CT scanner. 

The sample was sourced from Carolina Biologicla Supply, where it was fixed and stored in Carolina "Perfect" Solution. It was stained by Paul Gignac with buffered lugol's iodine (2.5% for 14 days).

Micro-CT scanning took place at the University of Arizona Nanofabrication Laboratory by Paul Gignac. Parameters included 150 kV, 120 micro-Amps, 2400 rotation steps, and 3-times image averaging. No filtration was used. 

Shimadzu metadata files (.txt, .jpg) are included with the repository. 

The volume file (.nrrd) is included with the repository.

A color table file (.ctbl) is included with the repository.

A text file describing the structures listed in the color table is included with the repository.
